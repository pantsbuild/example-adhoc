# example-adhoc
An example repository to demonstrate support for unsupported languages and arbitrary 3rd-party tools in Pants.

See [pantsbuild.org](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs) for much more detailed documentation.

This is only one possible way of laying out your project with Pants. See 
[pantsbuild.org/docs/source-roots#examples](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/source-roots#examples) for some other
example layouts.

This repository demonstrates advanced uses of Pants. For more introductory use cases, consider looking at `example-python` or `example-jvm`.
